OpenEmbedded/Yocto Distribution layer for Mentor Graphics
=========================================================

This layer holds the Mentor Embedded Linux distro configuration and
supplementary files, and acts as a staging area for changes which Mentor
Graphics requires, but which have not yet been merged into the upstream
layers.

This layer depends on:

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
Branch: master

URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-yocto
Revision: master

Content Review
==============

Distro bits
-----------

- base-files: issue files
- netbase: adjusted default interfaces file
- psplash: mel splash image
- core-image-base: added package-management
- e2fsprogs: killed e2fsprogs compat dep on blkid/badblocks
- archive-release: used to archive up content for release
- other packagegroups

- cml1-config class: consistent handling of defconfig -> .config with
  merge_configs.sh ala busybox & linux-yocto for fragments support
- kernel-config-lttng - use cml1-config to enable the bits needed by lttng
- user_features class: easier user manipulation of DISTRO_FEATURES from
  local.conf
- buildstats-summary class: using buildstats, show a summary at the end of
  the build showing how many recipes ran do_populate_sysroot vs
  do_populate_sysroot_setscene
- deploy-license-manifest class: this is fairly self explanatory. it
  deploys the manifest generated by license.bbclass into DEPLOY_DIR via an
  IMAGE_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND, and also runs a sed script which produces
  a CSV version of the manifest in DEPLOY_DIR
- mirrors class: a much simplified, compact version of the upstream
  default mirrors, without location-specific mirrors, and with more use of
  regex to reduce the number of entries
- sstate-mirror-sites class: provides a convenient mechanism to
  automatically check sstate mirrors in the default sstate extra path,
  specified fallback hosts for native recipes, and a flat layout. As one
  example, this means that a mirror can be populated with native sstate
  archives in a RedHatEnterprise-5 directory, and knowing we can run
  binaries from that host, it will check there on the mirror:

      SSTATE_MIRROR_DISTROS += "RedHatEnterprise-5"
      SSTATE_MIRROR_SITES += "file:///cache/sstate http://my.server/sstate-cache"

- isolated-sstate-dir class: link any used shared state archives into an
  isolated sstate directory, so we can distinguish between the contents of
  SSTATE_DIR and the sstate archives actually used for the build. This is
  needed by our release process.

Added recipes
-------------

- archive-release: this creates tarballs of the individual layers,
  downloads, shared state, images, etc for release or for inclusion in
  installers. this is used for Mentor Embedded Linux.
- chkconfig-alternatives - minimal target recipe, can be useful in
  a non-rpm environment if one wants to avoid cworth's update-alternatives
- binutils 2.17.50.0.12: originally from oe classic, pulled in for
  non-GPLv3 builds, so tools like oprofile and perf can be built and used
- lttng{0-ust,-control,-viewer}: recipes for lttng 0.x, for machines with
  old lttng 0.x patched kernels
- packagegroup-tools-benchmark: various benchmarking tools
- packagegroup-role-nas
- packagegroup-role-print-server
- packagegroup-role-router
- pyparted: this is currently unused by us, should be pushed to meta-oe
- udev 164: old udev for machines on old kernels

Changes pending upstream push
-----------------------------

- classes
    - license-fixup.bbclass - this should go into license.bbclass. alters
      the manifest generation to always emit the licenses, even if they
      have no generic license files in DEPLOY_DIR/license
- avahi-ui:
    - use PACKAGECONFIG for python module support, inherit python classes.
      without these bits, it will happy mess with the build machine's
      python
    - package avahi_discover in PYTHON_SITEPACKAGES_DIR
- curl: allow selection of openssl vs gnutls
- gconf: inherit gettext
- gnome-disk-utility
    - add PACKAGECONFIG for the build of the nautilus extension
- gnutls: update ${S}/lib/po/Makefile.in.in
- linux-omap4
    - disable build of kernel samples for pandaboard
- newt - splits out python module into a separate recipe. allows one to
  include libnewt in an image without sucking python into the build
- packagegroup-base: include dosfstools in packagegroup-base-vfat
- packagegroup-core-qt: define `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` for MIT
- packagegroup-core-ssh-openssh: define `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` for MIT
- packagegroup-core-tools-profile:
    - fix inclusion of lttng bits for mips, now that liburcu has mips
      support
    - include lttng 0.x packages for machines on old kernels which are
      patched for lttng 0.x
- perf
- portmap:
    - obey our target paths (base_sbindir, mandir)
- samba
    - disable avahi support (build determinism issue)
    - without acl support (build determinism issue)
- subversion: switch to apache archive to avoid fetch issues
- wireless-tools
- wpa-supplicant: add variable to select gnutls vs openssl
- xz: adjusts license so it's clear GPLv3 files aren't shipped. upstream
  fixed this too, in a different way, but I think ours is superior, as it
  lets LICENSE reflect source licensing while the package licenses reflect
  what's shipped

Tracing
-------

All of these should be moved into meta-tracing:

- linux-imx
- linux-qoriq-sdk
- linux-omap4
- lttng-modules: a couple fixes, switch from 2.1.1 to 2.1.0 with
  intermediate commits from the master branch which incorporates
  additional probes

DSO Link Change
---------------

- shared-mime-info

Disabled parallel make / install
--------------------------------

- gettext
- libtool
- lttng2-ust
- openssh

Remanant PR/PRINC bumps
-----------------------

These can be dropped as soon as the recipe PV is bumped, but are kept around
for now to avoid the package versions going backwards.

- blktrace
- gdbm
- hostap
- imx-lib
- irda-utils
- packagegroup-core-device-devel
- perl
- python
- setserial
- wireless-tools

Misc
----

- busybox: dep on meta-oe's fbset-modes if CONFIG_FBSET=y
- binutils-libs, oprofile: add and use more minimal binutils recipe for
  oprofile. This recipe just builds libbfd and libiberty
- libffi: patches for mips o32/n32
- boot-format: use a different repo with additional files
- udev: retained 164 recipe for machines that still need it
