#  "dbg-pkgs"        - add -dbg packages for all installed packages

#  "dev-pkgs"        - add -dev packages for all installed packages
#                      (useful if you want to develop against libs in the image)
#  "tools-sdk"       - add development tools (gcc, make, pkgconfig etc.)
#  "tools-debug"     - add debugging tools (gdb, strace)
#  "tools-profile"   - add profiling tools (oprofile, exmap, lttng valgrind (x86 only))
#  "tools-benchmark" - add benchmarking tools (bonnie++, netperfc, lmbench, etc)
#  "tools-testapps"  - add useful testing tools (ts_print, aplay, arecord etc.)
#  "codebench-debug" - core debug tools for use with codebench. this is
#                      a subset of tools-debug (gdbserver, strace, sftp server)
#  "debug-tweaks"    - make an image suitable for development
#                      e.g. ssh root access has a blank password
#  "x11-mini"        - minimal x11 setup, with window manager and terminal
#
#  These are for particular roles/purposes:
#
#  "nas"             - add tools for a network access storage server (samba, nfs, swat)

#
# There are other options that can be used here, see
# meta/classes/image.bbclass and meta/classes/core-image.bbclass for more

# Interactive shell configuration

# can launch an interactive shell. It needs to do this since the build is
# multithreaded and needs to be able to handle the case where more than one parallel
# process may require the user's attention. The default is iterate over the available
# terminal types to find one that works.
#
# Examples of the occasions this may happen are when resolving patches which cannot
# be applied, to use the devshell or the kernel menuconfig
#
# Supported values are auto, gnome, xfce, rxvt, screen, konsole (KDE 3.x only), none
# Note: currently, Konsole support only works for KDE 3.x due to the way
# newer Konsole versions behave

# than 100K inodes in any key build location (TMPDIR, DL_DIR, SSTATE_DIR), gracefully
# shutdown the build. If there is less that 100MB or 1K inodes, perform a hard abort
# of the build. The reason for this is that running completely out of space can corrupt
# files and damages the build in ways which may not be easily recoverable.
