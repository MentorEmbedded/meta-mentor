#                      (adds symbol information for debugging/profiling)
#  "dev-pkgs"        - add -dev packages for all installed packages
#                      (useful if you want to develop against libs in the image)
#  "tools-sdk"       - add development tools (gcc, make, pkgconfig etc.)
#  "tools-debug"     - add debugging tools (gdb, strace)
#  "tools-profile"   - add profiling tools (oprofile, exmap, lttng valgrind (x86 only))
#  "tools-benchmark" - add benchmarking tools (bonnie++, netperfc, lmbench, etc)
#  "tools-lttng"     - add tools for the Linux Trace Toolkit
#  "tools-testapps"  - add useful testing tools (ts_print, aplay, arecord etc.)
#  "codebench-debug" - core debug tools for use with codebench. this is
#                      a subset of tools-debug (gdbserver, strace, sftp server)
#  "debug-tweaks"    - make an image suitable for development
#                      e.g. ssh root access has a blank password
#  "x11-mini"        - minimal x11 setup, with window manager and terminal
#
#  These are for particular roles/purposes:
#
#  "nas"             - add tools for a network access storage server (samba, nfs, swat)
#  "print-server"    - add tools for a print server (samba, swat)
#  "router"          - add tools for a router/accesspoint (ipsec-tools, iproute2, iptables, etc)
#
#  "read-only-rootfs" - enables creation of a Read-Only root file system
#                       (removes first-time config at start-up, mounts root r/o,
#                        and relocates dynamically created data to a tmpfs)
#
#  The following options are valid when the meta-mentor-qa-private layer is included:
#  "extra-qa-packages"               - enables additional packages to be included in the target image.
#  "extra-qa-kernel-configs"         - enables additional kernel config options used by QA.
#  "extra-qa-kernel-configs-modules" - changes some additional config options to modules for QA.
#  "gcov-kernel-configs"             - enables GCOV kernel config options used by QA.
#  "audio-kernel-configs"            - enables additionale audio kernel config options used by QA.
#
# There are other options that can be used here, see
# meta/classes/image.bbclass and meta/classes/core-image.bbclass for more

#   - 'image-prelink' in order to prelink the filesystem image
#   - 'image-swab' to perform host system intrusion detection

# mklibs library size optimization is more useful to smaller images,
# and less useful for bigger images. Also mklibs library optimization

# Interactive shell configuration
#
# Under certain circumstances the system may need input from you and to do this it
# can launch an interactive shell. It needs to do this since the build is
# multithreaded and needs to be able to handle the case where more than one parallel
# process may require the user's attention. The default is iterate over the available
# terminal types to find one that works.
#
# Examples of the occasions this may happen are when resolving patches which cannot
# be applied, to use the devshell or the kernel menuconfig
#
# Supported values are auto, gnome, xfce, rxvt, screen, konsole (KDE 3.x only), none
# Note: currently, Konsole support only works for KDE 3.x due to the way
# newer Konsole versions behave

# Shared-state files from other locations
#
# The SSTATE_MIRROR_SITES variable can be used to configure the system to
# search other mirror locations for these objects before it builds the data
# itself.
#
# This can be a filesystem directory, or a remote url such as http or ftp.
# These would contain the sstate-cache results from previous builds (possibly
# from other machines). This variable works like fetcher MIRRORS/PREMIRRORS
