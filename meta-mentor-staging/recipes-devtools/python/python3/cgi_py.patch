-# NOTE: the above "/usr/local/bin/python" is NOT a mistake.  It is
-# intentionally NOT "/usr/bin/env python".  On many systems
-# (e.g. Solaris), /usr/local/bin is not in $PATH as passed to CGI
-# scripts, and /usr/local/bin is the default directory where Python is
-# installed, so /usr/bin/env would be unable to find python.  Granted,
-# binary installations by Linux vendors often install Python in
-# /usr/bin.  So let those vendors patch cgi.py to match their choice
-# of installation.
